          In its current state, Twitter is an ever-growing social network which includes a huge amount of data that contains opinions of people, their feelings about a specific subject or events and more. Twitter enables its users to write tweets about whatever they want. As a result, those opinions influence a variety of domains like politics. Moreover, Businesses use it to market their product to the right customers and to gather feedback on their product.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to analyze the huge amount of data available to them by twitter, researchers are searching for automated tools for accurate and effective analysis of the data. The main goal of our system is to predict the sentiment of tweets and the geo-location of their authors. The subject of tweets in interest can be specified by query, compiled from keywords and/or hashtags provided by the end user.
        </p>
        <h4>Main Methods:</h4>
        <ul>
          
          <li>
              The sentiment is predicted by a model which is based on the supervised learning with the BiDirectional Long Short Term Memory(BiLSTM) algorithm.
          </li>
          <li>
              Prediction of the location is computed by a model which is also based on the supervised learning algorithm – Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
          </li>
          <li>
              The learning algorithms are implemented in Python with the TensorFlow machine learning framework.
          </li>
          <li>
              The trained models are deployed with the help of TensorFlow Serving – a flexible, high-performance serving system for machine learning models.

        </ul>
        <h4>Results:</h4>
        <ul>
          
          <li>
              The sentiment analysis model has an accuracy of 85% for positive/negative classification.<br>

          </li>
          <li>
              The geolocation prediction model has an accuracy of 87% for classifying a tweet to a specific country.<br>
