# Aquarium GUI - ThreadPool based on Java Swing
## Multiple Design Patterns
1. singleton - creating one worm as food <br>
2. abstract factory - abstract factory of the creatures (animal, plant) <br>
3. prototype - to duplicat the objects <br>
4. observer/listener - update the animals about the worm <br>
5. decorator - add functionallity like color chaning of the animals via tha panel <br>
6. mementoc - save last states of an animal, like color, coordinates in the aquarium, etc. <br>
7. state - change the state of the animal into hungry/satiated <br>

## Race conidition (worm food) mitigated via Monitor
