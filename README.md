# My Works
## Many project and mini-projects based on multipile languages and technologies
Including Deep Learning (e.g., Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Chainer), Reinforcement Learning, Python, C, C++,.NET(C#), Java, Javascript and Angular.
### Examples
1. NLP question answering (sequence modeling) based on Transformers ( at Deep Learning/Transformers/NLP_Sequence_modeling_Original_Transformer). <br>
2. Vision image classification based on Vision Transformers (VIT) ( at Deep Learning/Transformers/Vision_ViT_Transformer_Image_classification). <br>
3. Detecting perturbation attacks on Semantic Segmentation Models (SSM) via Object Detection Model (ODM) ( at Deep Learning/SSM ODM). <br>
4. Twitter Geo-Sentiment Analysis based on CNN and LSTM (at WEB (+DL)/Deep Learning + Angular + Flask/GeoSentiment Analysis). <br>
5. Captcha Cracking based on CRNN ( at Deep Learning/CaptchaCracking). <br>
6. DQN, DDQN, Reinforce and Actor-crtitics algorithms for known toy example environments (e.g., Cart-Pole, Acrobot, etc) (at Reinforcement Learning).<br>
<br>
And many more...
